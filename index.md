## EmShot & EmThreat
Our team believes every company, regardless of cyber-capability, should be aware of the threats they face. We release open-source software while providing premium services to extend that software. 


### Gear Up for the Hunt
The EmThreat tool is free and lets you see what is lurking out there in the web. EmThreat will break down datasets to identify new trends that could impact your organization, while giving you the ability to tweak the tool to your use cases.

The EmShot platform is an online service to generate custom reports, integrate feeds with your SEIM, build custom rules, and manage security alerts for your departments. It is a sonar for emerging threats.


### Feeding Frenzy for SOCs
We believe that SOCs need open-source threat intelligence. Submit your finds to public sites like PhishTank and URLhaus to help your fellow security analysts out. They will repay the favor when you need it most. By crowd-sourcing threats, everyone can be on the same page.
